# custom_bioclim-envirem

this repository and the two scripts (for now) incuded in It are used to create custom bioclimatc variables such as in Worldclim and Envirem variables (such as in Title P.O., Bemmels J.B., 2018) with the use of climatic data derived form CHELSA over a custom period.

Note: The scripts are raw and possibly clustered with errors, user caution is advised.
